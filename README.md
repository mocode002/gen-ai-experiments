# Gen AI Experiments 🧪

A collection of deep learning and generative AI experiments exploring sequence modeling, computer vision, and NLP. 
This repository contains practical implementations of custom neural network architectures using **PyTorch**.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. [Music Generation with RNNs](./music_generation) 🎵
**Goal:** Generate original Irish folk music in ABC notation using Recurrent Neural Networks.
* **Architecture:** LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) with Embedding layers.
<!-- * **Key Techniques:** Sequence prediction, text vectorization, custom PyTorch `Dataset`, temperature sampling for creative generation. -->
* **Data:** "Irishman" dataset (ABC notation).

### 2. [Image Captioning with Attention](./image_captioning) 🖼️
**Goal:** Generate descriptive captions for images by combining Computer Vision and NLP.
* **Architecture:** ResNet50 (Encoder) + Custom LSTM with Attention (Decoder).
<!-- * **Key Techniques:** Transfer Learning, implementing **Bahdanau Attention** from scratch, integrating pre-trained **Word2Vec** embeddings. -->
* **Data:** Flickr30k.
